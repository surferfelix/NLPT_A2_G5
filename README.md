## PROJECT STRUCTURE
-------------------
This project tackles the NLP task of Semantic Role labeling (SRL) with rule based and traditional along with neural machine learning approaches. Semantic roles involve identification of

**What you will find in this project:**
- _A rule based system for predicate and argument identification_
- _Traditional ML systems for predicate and argument identification, along with argument classification_
- _A neural SRL system that can tackle SRL on its own_

## IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

the token
indices, tokens, lemmas, universal Part-of-Speech tags, language-specific Part-of-Speech tags,
morphological features, the ID of the head word, the universal dependency relation to the head
word, as well as head ID - dependency relation pairs

## HOW TO USE IT
- STEP 1. Install libraries specified in **requirements.txt** by running    
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`    
- STEP 2. Run main.py with proper argumenst eg. **python3 main.py 'yes' 'relative_path_to_test_data'
- STEP 3.
- STEP 4.
